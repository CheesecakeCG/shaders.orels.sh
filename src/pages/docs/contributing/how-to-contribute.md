description: How to contribute to the ORL Shaders
---

ORL Shaders are an evolving project, and I'll be happy to accept any contributions you may have. If you want to contribute, I recommend starting by playing around with [the shaders](/docs/shaders-list), [the inspector](/docs/inspector/overview), and [the generator](/docs/generator/development-basics).

The generator [Development Basics](/docs/generator/development-basics) guide is an essential piece of documentation to read before contributing to the generator. It goes over the general structure of each shader and how all of it comes together.

## Reporting Bugs

If you spot a bug in the shaders, please [open an issue](https://github.com/orels1/orels-Unity-Shaders/issues/new) on GitHub. Please include the following information:

- Version of Unity you're using
- Version of the shaders you're using
- A screenshot if possible
- Any console errors you're getting
- A platform you're building for (PC/Android/Mac)

You can also [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/orels1) and create a new support request there in the #help-and-dev forum!
